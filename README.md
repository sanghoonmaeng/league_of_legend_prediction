# Overview
League of Legends ("LoL") is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games. With millions of players worldwide, it has become a competitive eSports phenomenon. Two teams of five players play against each other to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures. Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game and respawn upon death. Non-player characters, the minions, are generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy Nexus along the three lanes, where it contains the three "inhibitors. Destroying an inhibitor spawns a super minions in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and the last two guard turrets. The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", with neutral monsters that respawn at regular intervals. Most importantly, powerful monsters spawn in each side of the river, where killing the monster grant special abilities to the slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and/or, a strong buff that enhances the allied minions by killing the Baron Nashor.
